							<h2>Group Reflection</h2>

						</header>
						<p>The results of this project lead one to conclude that teamwork is one of the most useful tools that can be used to enhance learning and
						promote critical thinking skills for all of us. This project gave us a very good opportunity to reflect on teamwork, such as the value of teamwork, 
						the importance of organisation and structure when it comes to teamwork, 
						and aspects relating to the contribution of individual members within our team and how it may affect the final project outcome. </p>

						<p>Additionally, the results obtained from the interviews showed that reflection writing has several benefits in the classroom in terms of identifying the present state of knowledge gained in a particular course and help them become more self-independent learners. Interview results showed that the reflection was perceived as being a very beneficial tool for the participants in terms of identifying ones strengths and weaknesses (P3), or to improve and evaluate actions properly. Additionally, it was also reported that the reflection is also beneficial to examine students’ experiences and assess himself (P7). 
						Most importantly, it is beneficial because it will help us correct our own mistakes and we will not repeat them in the future (P10). </p>
						
						<p>Finally, Morzano’s Taxonomy showed that while writing a reflection students were able to express their attitudes, beliefs, and emotions about learning. 
						Also, they could monitor and evaluate their progress throughout a course and comprehend, analyze and utilize new knowledge as it was presented above.</p>
						
						<p>This was shown in the second interview, where the participant stated that 
						“After several classes, I am now able to find meanings of some concepts and make connections with new information”. 
						It is evident that the reflection helped this student to monitor and evaluate his own learning. 
						Or, in example 3 “I use some learning strategies but there are so many new ones, for example the Key Word Method”, 
						which shows that the student analyzed the use of his own learning strategies.</p>
						
						<p>All in all, this study showed some interesting results on using a reflection paper as a self-assessment tool for learning EFL at a University level. 
							We strongly believe that the results of the study will serve other educators and raise their awareness about its importance in education. </p>
						
						<h2><a name="_Toc69739736"></a>Justin Healy</h2>
						<p>For Assignment 3 the group really kicked off with the momentum from the last assignment. We used roughly the same structure of work allocation as in Assignment 2,
							but with some added refinement from what we learnt previously. We learnt that the percentage of grading weight assigned to each section of the project is a good indicator of the amount of work expected. </p>
						<p>So, we calculated the sections and split them as equally as possible to ensure everybody will complete the same percentage of the project. 
							This, I believe, was a smart move. This project is much larger, and if the work requirements skew to steeply towards one person it could quickly become overwhelming.  </p>
						<p>We could improve on making sure our allocated sections are developed more in line with the other members of the group. Going forward, we should make it one of our aims to be more conscientious of the group performance as a whole. 
						And communicate our ideas in more efficient manner so that our allocated sections reflect one another and build on each other.  </p>
						<p>But overall, the experience has been a very positive one. The group has been cooperative, understanding and focused in completing our assignments together.
						Everybody has contributed their skills and abilities to the groups benefit and I would hope our work thus far will reflect this. </p>
						
						
						<h2><a name="_Toc69739737"></a>James Stathakis</h2>
						<p>After completing Assessment 2 with the group, I felt, personally, that I had let my team down, and didn’t carry my weight. The group made sure to not portray this, which I am appreciative of, and leading into Assessment 3, I vowed to do more. I vowed to interact more with the team, carry my weight, and do the parts assigned to me. Reflecting on this, I feel I had done this to sufficient effect. </p>
						<p>From the first meeting on A3, it was clear that Alice Wen Lin was our De Facto leader of the group. She was the consul for the group, giving us direction, planning and other qualities of a leader. When I had questions about my input toward A3, I went to Alice, privately, for assistance, which was provided. She kept tabs on my progress, and this was helpful for A3.  </p>
						<p>For the group meetings, my attendance was subpar. There were scheduled meetings that I was committed to attending, in which their timetable shifted to perhaps the night before or after. This was typically sorted in the morning, before I awoke, so I missed them. I still attended some of the meetings, and those that I did attend had a general direction/order to abide by.  </p>
						<p>Through little work of mine, (although I had the beginnings of one), the projects were a success, despite our collective skills/abilities/experience, and I believe that if we, as a group continued the projects, we’d be able to continue to be successful with the project(s). </p>

						<h2><a name="_Toc69739738"></a>Alice Wen Lin</h2>
						<p>Effective teamwork is critical to implementing and executing a common goal more quickly and efficiently in a team project. Each individual in our team possesses unique sets of abilities, weaknesses, strengths, and habits. As a result, it was critical to distribute the workload evenly according to these individual assets to ensure that everyone is satisfied and engaged in their roles.  </p>
						<p>During our first meeting, I divided the assignment into segments based on specific percentage values, and then each member selected their preferred section. However, once everyone began working, it became clear that this would not be easy, given how interconnected and dependent each area of the assignment was. </p>
						<p>We lacked interdependence, and since everyone is working remote, 
						it was difficult for us to create an effective group environment for all of us to work on one prototype; and since it’s the most busiest time of the whole semester, it became harder to get everyone together. </p>
						<p>As a result, in the last couple of weeks, we determined that rather than concentrating exclusively on a single large prototype, it would probably be better to develop multiple prototypes, test them, and then evaluate the positives and negatives associated with each, just as we would in the real world. </p>
						<p>One of our team's greatest accomplishments was the dedication of the majority of our members.
						While getting everyone together was not always easy, team meetings were always pleasant, and no team issues were ever discussed as problematic. Our team was constantly focused on the project and ways to improve the development process by examining tutor, client, and end user expectations.</p>
						<p> Everyone was always willing to assist peers when they encountered difficulties with their sections, proactively brainstormed problems, offered assistance when necessary, and engaged in open dialogue that expressed concerns in an unaggressive manner. </p>
						<p>However, as I previously stated in the profile section, unlike working on a real-world project, 
						there was an absence of leadership. This resulted in difficulties in getting everyone together and lacking unity and consistency throughout the assignment, especially mid-way. </p>
						<p>However, we resolved this issue by dividing the team into smaller subteams, each testing and working on different prototypes instead of working on one large prototype, with only a few members working on it. Therefore ultimately, our group achieved the goal of a cohesive team; despite dips in the middle, team cohesion was higher at the end of the semester than at the start.  </p>
						<p>Overall this team project turned out to be a very positive experience for me, 
						and it a little sad that we've reached the end. Throughout the process, I've gained a firm grasp of my role's characteristics and learned how to maximize my strengths and abilities, also minimizing my weaknesses. </p>
						<p>Successful teamwork relies on more than just one attribute but multiple, and it shows a compelling relationship between our team members who embraced these attributes. Although we are all year one IT students, the project was a success, and with additional time, I believe we can turn this into something tangible. </p>

						<h2><a name="_Toc69739738"></a>Marc Valpiani</h2>
						<p>On reflection, the added practical element of assignment 3 made this take the most challenging yet. The requirement to produce a real technical solution was challenging; luckily, we had some team members who had some more experience in development who could rise to the challenge.   </p>
						<p>One aspect of our group’s processes that could have been improved is taking more time to truly understand the assignment specification at the start of the assignment. There have been times during the assignment when we have done or planned to do work that may not have been entirely necessary due to differing views of what the assignment required.   </p>
						<p>As a group, we have worked hard to communicate even though we are a fully remote team. The members on our team all have different work and personal commitments that make it somewhat difficult to align our schedules and find time to work together.   </p>
						<p>In agreement with Alice, one of the most difficult parts of working on a project like this is the lack of clear leadership as we are all peers. However, in her group role as project manager, she did a great job of coordinating the group’s effort producing documentation that helped us understand our progress and responsibilities. </p>
						
		

						<h2><a name="_Toc69739739"></a>John Hurst</h2>
						<p>The group's ability to work on individual tasks, issues, etc. is at a prominent level. Each person conducts themselves proficiently and without complaint. Each person has their own individual abilities and skills, although differing in approach, overall, the team worked well together. There were no arguments or differing opinions or opposing views on how to proceed with the project. We were all singular in our endeavor to get the job done.</p>
						<p>I have said this several times, communication is the number one thing that needs work. Especially at the start. Everybody seemed distracted at first. Unsure of themselves, overwhelmed with the expectations of the task before them. Communication was at its lowest point during the beginning period. I think, the enormity of the task was overwhelming us, the specifications or how to proceed was not understood. There seemed to be no formal process for developing a project.  </p>
						<p>What was needed was some time management software or tools to be able to create and assign tasks. I have investigated and discovered some time management or task/job assignment areas within MS Teams. I think that having only one file to update everything is not a very practical way of sharing our work.</p>
						<p>There are other software packages available to manage this better. Products which individualize and coordinate tasks. Defining start dates, time, estimated completion times, hours progressed, reporting details, etc. Having a better way to understand what others were doing and how they were going with it would have been extremely useful and reassuring. </p>
						<p>We lacked formal leadership. Appointing a leader, or a manager, would be a more practical approach. Their sole responsibility would have been to organize and assign tasks to each member without them being required to do anything else. Rather than waiting and hoping someone would volunteer themselves as group leader, by this time we should have been capable of deciding on who was to lead.  </p>
						<p>In the end, by virtue of having been her project idea from the start, Alice did begin assigning tasks and managing us a little better. However, this should have been decided much earlier on. I think, we could have together achieved a little more. Alice produced some excellent excel documents to assist us to focus. However, as previously stated having more formal job allocation areas within MS Teams would have been more structured. </p>
						<p>My surprise was the team's continual dedication to achieving a result, nobody gave in to frustration or the lack of direction. Everybody soldiered on without complaint. A never give up attitude that prevailed. That surprised me, at one point in the beginning, I thought this was coming apart and we were not going to get a result at all. So, yes that surprised me! </p>
						<p>I have learned that leadership is important, but not always an absolute must. However, when focus and direction become haphazard and chaotic, then strong leadership is required. But it is not a 'must have' attribute. If the mindset and goals of all members are well aligned, it does not matter. If all are skilled, dedicated, and knowledgeable it will tend to function well without solid leadership.  </p>
						<p>However, having said that, upon further reflection our organizational structure occurred more by default than anything else. Given a different task or project to fulfill this may not have worked well, if at all. </p>
						<p>Overall, do not underestimate a team's ability to really buckle down and find solutions when needed. Do not be too quick to judge and despair, give it a chance. Again patience. But, when it does not go so well, then nothing beats structured organizational processes none of which we utilized. </p>

						<p>The important thing about being part of this team 14 in the group projects is that everyone has contributed their skills and expertise for finishing our project in timely manner.  The benefit of working in the group 14 is everyone has different perspectives, and they all contribute their ideas and actively listening to other team members and implement better way to finish the project. </p>
						<p>I think I learned to keep track of my progress and communicate more effectively with other team members to ensure that the project progresses in timely manner.  </p>
						<p>The Challenges that our group faced is to divide the work so everyone will contribute the same amount for the project. It’s good that in the first meeting in week 1, We discussed right away about our project goals, and we have divided our workload so it’s also fair for everyone. </p>
						<p>I also feel that the other challenge we don’t really have the team leader for this project because we feel everyone are responsible for finishing our group projects in time. I think it’s good that Alice has been managing and following with everyone about their current sections in the projects to ensure that we can finish our projects on time. </p>
						<p>Team meeting helped us to keep track of our progress and giving us more ideas with implementation with the Chat Bot programs and finding out better ways to make better use of technology. </p>
						<p>Overall, we managed our challenges well and I think this is really good experience for working in real world projects.  I learned a lot of new things and exploring different technologies to find out which best practices for the Chat Bot development. </p>

						<h3>The Webpage</h3>
						<br>
						<p>The first group website was established at the beginning of the assignment. However, this was not used. Myself (John), and Justin were the only two to have completed our work and commited any contend to this page.</p>
						<p><a href="https://github.com/s3882857/stunning-inspiration">https://github.com/s3882857/stunning-inspiration</a></p>
						<p>The eventual website was initiated within the final week of the assignment due date. The majority of the commits were performed by one person. A few alterations were conducted by one or two others after reviewing the work. Minor tweaks, and readding inadvertantly missed content etc. This does not accurately represent the work load split of the group.</p>

						<h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
						<br>
						<p>This was the area where the majority of our communication was conducted. The chatting area in particular. Our group meetings were also conducted through this environment.</p>
						<p>At first, it was a little slow to begin with, but once everybody developed a competent understanding of the platform, its utilization subsequently increased.</p>
						<p>It should be understood, that not everybody is contactible and easily accessible owing to other commitments (work), but overall everybody got in the habit of regularly checking it and contributing and answering questions when asked.</p>
						<p>All of us attempted to use the 'Files' section well. Although, the level of documentation needs to increase. A review of this process, in particular the 'check in' and 'check out' procedures. As nobody did this there is potential for conflict here.</p>
						<p>A worksplit document was established at the very beginning. However, it was not always referred to, myself included. The document needs to be divided up into the relevant sections and then reamalgameted towards the end.</p>
						<p>The bulk of the contend was not shared until the very end. Progress needs to be shown and committed to the repository on a daily basis if and when possible. This would enable a clearer and better understanding of everyones progress. Above all, it would promote a peer review system. Although, this did not seem to hinder us from acheiving a pleasing result.</p>
