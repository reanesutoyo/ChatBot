						<h3><a name="_Toc69739714"></a>Justin Healy,</h3>
						<img src="images/justin.png" width="200">
						<p>Student number S3886040 Email -
						<a href="mailto:S3886040@student.rmit.edu.au">S3886040@student.rmit.edu.au</a></p>
						<p>Personal website link:
						<a href="https://s3886040.github.io/Assignment01/">https://s3886040.github.io/Assignment01/</a></p>
						<p>Fluent in German, a runner, and health enthusiast. Justin Healy really gained some IT
							traction after he completed a web development bootcamp for 3 month during his stay in Berlin
							where he was able to gain insight into some high-level Java Script. His interest eventually
							led to his decision to study through OUA to obtain his higher education in RMIT for
							Information Technology.</p>
						<p>He currently has experience in web programming using primarily JavaScript, and have
							experience using different java-script frameworks such as React, jQuery and Vue. Through
							working with apps in the past, he developed skills with database processing with relevant
							HTML and CSS skills. Additional Justin worked in a 3-year car rental company while living
							abroad in Germany, where he was able to gain experience in customer service and relations.
							His position to work in the rental reservations department gave him the opportunity to work
							and solve issues with customers; on daily basis he had to liaise with other departments in
							the company, sourcing and processing relevant company data, and construct resolutions for
							customers.</p>
						<h6>ISFJ-T</h6>
						<p>As a “defender”, Justin is a very focused and dedicated individual who enjoys helping others and meeting other’s need when it comes to working in a team. He takes in a lot of pride by being a considerate individual who is actively aware of people’s emotions around him, unintentionally, he connects everyone in the team, creating harmony and happiness among everyone, this makes him a natural networker and a very valuable person in any workplace or team.</p>
						<h3>GROUP PROCESS</h3>

						<p>In assignment Two, we worked really well individually and as a team. I believe we can work together even better this time around as we 
							enter the world of IT and our new careers as IT professionals. </p>

						<p>This time I would like to see us use our individual skills and qualities for the betterment of the team. For this project
						we have an opportunity to dive a little deeper into what our project could be and develop and implement our ideas into reality. </P>
						<h3>CAREER PLANS</h3>

						<p>In assignment 2 my ideal job was QA tester/ QA analyst. This has not changed since that point in time. However, with a more enlightened view of things since then. I have reevaluated the timeline. I think I would benefit from first experiencing life in a development team creating and developing software with a view to becoming a tester in the long term.
						This will greatly benefit me as a tester and help me be the best tester I can be. </p>
						
						<h3><a name="_Toc69739715"></a>Marc Valpiani,</h3>
						<img src="images/marc.jpeg" width="200">
						<p>Student number: S3907456  Email:

								<a href="mailto:S3907456@student.rmit.edu.au">S3907456@student.rmit.edu.au</a></p>
						<p>Personal website link:
						<a href="https://mvalpi528.github.io/IntroToITAssingment1/">https://mvalpi528.github.io/IntroToITAssingment1/</a></p>
						<p>Marc is a professional musician and Music Educator. A native Aussie with a cultural
							background of Italian and Irish. He enjoys the outdoors and spend most of recreational time
							surfing and swimming whenever possible. His interest in IT started in his interests in
							gaming in the late 90s, a time when computer gaming has just started. At that time his ideal
							career was to become a game developer, however, his interest in Music eventually became his
							sole focus where he trained himself as aprofessional musician, the field that he
							currently works in.</p>
						<p>Through his journey for self-development, he started to look for new career opportunities
							that were both Intellectually challenging and presented opportunities for long term career
							development, this is when he turned back to Technology. With skills in Python and JavaScript
							that he was able to learn through Codecademy; and some other self-taught skills in HTML and
							CSS, he decided to jump back into tertiary study to follow a more structured program and
							receive a recognised qualification at the end of his studies at RMIT in Information
							Technology.</p>
						<h6>INTJ-A</h6>
						<p>A potential influence within a team is the added self-awareness that he can provide.
							Heightened self-awareness may allow everyone in the team to catch when one is behaving in a
							way that is detrimental to the team and give insight as to why this may be the case. When
							working in a team, he is generally very good at taking criticism, this type doesn&rsquo;t
							take things personally and won&rsquo;t get emotional when conflicts do occur. To him,
							warranted criticism is a somewhat practice for them to improve.</p>
						<h3>GROUP PROCESS</h3>

						<p>In summary I thought that our team came together quite well in assignment two. 
						Throughout the assignment we had a steep learning curve trying to familiarize ourselves with several new technologies such as GitHub and Microsoft Teams. By the end of the assessment, we were able to use teams in a way that allowed us to work in a ‘synchronous’ and ‘asynchronous’ way, attending group meetings via 
						conference call and using the chat function to keep in touch when we were working at different times as a result of our different work schedules. </p>
						In the final stages of the project, 
						we were able to all help our lead web developer Alice with the site,
						using GitHub to simultaneously work on the code for the website, 
						fixing some last-minute bugs to publish our website before the deadline.</p>
						<h3>CAREER PLANS</h3>

						<p>Alice made a great observation about how our preferred job titles match our personalities. 
						This is an interesting insight as it gives some context about why certain people are drawn to certain jobs. 
						In my case I think I had previously ruled out certain job titles as I thought I did not have the right personality type for the role, 
						but after finishing this unit I am now open to roles that I had not previously considered. </p>
						<p>I now have a few more areas that I would like to investigate as potential career paths, namely Cyber-Security, 
						Machine Learning/Data Science applied to business analytics or Economics. Before this course, I had never considered Cyber-Security as a career path, 
						but the modules/course chats have sparked an interest in the area for me and
						have now found a new favorite podcast called Darknet Diaries which features some incredible stories about hacking and cyber security. </p>
						<p>In my search to find a new career path, I spent some time studying business and enjoyed Economics as a subject in high school. 
						It seems that there is a promising area of cross over for people who are competent in both worlds and can act as a bridge between them.
						This could be as simple as translating between business development teams and software development teams 
						ranging to using machine learning techniques to make sense of the huge data sets generated by businesses today. </p>
			
				
						<h3><a name="_Toc69739716"></a>James Stathakis,</h3>
						<img src="images/james.jpeg" width="200">
						<p>Student number:   Email:

								<a href="mailto:s3909456@student.rmit.edu.au">s3909456@student.rmit.edu.au</a></p>
						<p>Personal website link:
						<a href="https://o-mauler-o.github.io/JamesITProfile_Landing/ ">https://o-mauler-o.github.io/JamesITProfile_Landing/</a></p>

						<p>James Stathakis is 20 years old, he was born in Sydney and raised in Canberra. Due to
							COVID-19 that hit in 2020, he moved back to Tasmania to be with his parents where he
							remained till the present. He enjoys sports such as AFL and Hokey that he has played since
							he was young. As a child James was skilled in Mathematics, until around 14 years ago where
							he developed interest in video games and eventually became a skilled Gamer. Video games
							changed James &ldquo;for the better or worse&rdquo; he states, this led him to pursue his
							passion in higher education in IT at RMIT. James is can also speak French, and through his
							first employment at the two sisters caf&eacute; in Canberra, he was able to gain skills and
							passion that he really enjoyed.</p>
						<h6>INFP-T</h6>
						<p>James is a Mediator at the heart and is always trying to diffuse conflicts before they get
							out of hand, he could solidify a team if conflicts arise, bringing a team close together,
							with a caring, understanding personality, as well as keeping it together.</p>
				
						<h3>GROUP PROCESS</h3> 

						<p>In Assessment 2, things were rocky from my perspective. They were rocky mainly due to me, and another member that never made an appearance. 
						Essentially, with a few combined incidents, my participation with the group was minimal. 
						However, the rest of the group, despite this, worked together, and never made me feel left out or useless, and even when, 
						right at the end, I found myself wondering if I could help, I was given paths to follow to help the team. 
						In Assessment 3, I strived to do my part of the Assessment as much as I could, with the timeframe that I had. </p>
						<p>The group teamwork was exemplary, but it really demonstrated the leadership that some of my group members possessed. 
						It was clear to me from the start that I lacked the life experience in comparison to my group members, 
						but they more than made up for it, and was able to keep the work on track.</p>
				
						<h3>CAREER PLANS</h3>

						<p>Since I was a child, I have always had the stereotypical dream to join the Army. 
						As I got older, that focus shifted toward different paths in the army, starting as an Enlisted infantryman,
						to joining the Armored Corps, to now, as an adult, my focus has shifted into work as a Cyber Analyst for the Army/Airforce. 
						This is my current focus, and what I dream to do and be, through this course. For Assessment 1, I picked 3 ideal jobs.
						They’re all very similar and they all fit into the IT department of the Armed forces. </p>
						<p>Throughout the introductory course, my focus for this career path has doubled, 
						and I believe I’m on the correct path for this career. Obviously, it’d start in the Military, 
						but eventually I’d retire from the military and put the skills acquired into the Civilian Market, 
						which would be a few decades down the path.</p>
			
			

						<h3><a name="_Toc69739717"></a>Alice Wen Lin,</h3>
						<img src="images/alice.jpeg" width="200">
						<p>Student number: S3905128  Email:<a
								href="mailto:S3905128@student.rmit.edu.au">S3905128@student.rmit.edu.au</a></p>
						
						<p>Personal website link: <a href="https://alicelinlin.github.io/">https://alicelinlin.github.io</a></p>
						
						<p>Alice (Wen Lin) is a Chinese Australian, raised in Sydney since the age of 7. After she
							graduated from High School, Alice started an E-commerce business mainly selling her own
							brand&rsquo;s line of women&rsquo;s clothing and accessories and now she currently operates
							a Hotel Management and Hospitality consulting firm based in Sydney, Australia. In order to
							pursue her dream in entrepreneurship, she dropped out of college, and has been working for
							the past 10 years. She is well skilled in Photoshop, Microsoft Suite, Web Development,
							Business Management, Operations, Sales, marketing and Business development. She enjoys art
							and design, music, spending time with family and friends, and most of all, traveling and has
							travelled to more than 50 countries abroad.</p>
						<p>Whether in business or social environment, Alice believes IT has transformed the way humans
							operate, with its fast-evolving technological enhancements, technology has revolutionized
							humankind and it will only progress further and faster in future.</p>
						<h6>ENFJ-A</h6>
						<p>Being the very outgoing, open, and extroverted person that Alice is, she enjoys working in a
							team rather than on her own. She is an observer and has good communication skills, with a
							strong intuition about the people around her. Using these skills, she can organise and
							assist members in taking advantage of their unique characteristics and traits, making me a
							great mediator if problems arise. She appreciates different perspectives and views and
							thrives on putting unique ideas into action. With her vibrant personality, she is able to
							create excellent and positive atmospheres in the group.</p>
						<h3>GROUP PROCESS</h3>

						<p>One of the most beneficial aspects of working in a team was the diverse perspectives 
						that everyone had on the assignment. Although there were some disagreements, 
						there were some excellent questions that prompted me to consider subjects I had not considered previously. 
						Although we were all working remotely, we were constantly communicating via messages and video conferencing in Microsoft Teams,
							which demonstrated our group's ability to work collaboratively and resolve issues.</p>
						<p>However, what made working in a team environment in a university setting unique was the lack of leadership. Unlike real-world projects, 
						where there is always a team leader or manager leading the team, there was no set leader for us, and as a result of the lack of leadership,
						there was sense in the lack of unity and structure in completing the assignment.</p>
						<p>Overall, the experience was positive and demonstrated to me how closely teamwork, 
						leadership, time management, and productivity are intertwined, and how a deficiency in any of these areas would have consequences.
						Individuals are most productive when they manage their time wisely, 
						and teamwork is most effective and effortless when all members work cooperatively toward the same goals. </p>
						<h3>CAREER PLANS</h3>

						<p>I have chosen Shopping Technical Specialist at google as my ideal job.
						As I have mentioned in assignment 1, The most significant thing that made me appealing to this post is 
						the play on technical grounds where I will be working with several technologies as well as the interactions
						from dealing with customers. 
						This position is not just an IT specialist but also gives me a chance to make connections
						and build a relationship with these customers and clients that may be beneficial in the long run.</p> 
						<p>The industry data helped me gain a better understanding of both my career and 
						the ideal careers of the rest of the team. It's fascinating how each of us choose
						careers that reflected our personality assessments. Although each team member's career options are
						quite distinct, the required skills for several of these careers were quite similar. 
						For instance, surprisingly similar skills were required for positions as disparate as 
						quality assurance analysts and software programmers. 
						My career is probably the most dissimilar to the rest of the group; rather than requiring extensive technical skills, it required less specialized IT skills, such as excellent communication, marketing, and planning.</p>
						<p>I don’t think industry data has actually changed what I wanted for my idea job, but gaining a better understanding of industry data  did allow me to gain a better insight on what the trends are, what are the most high demand technical skills to learn, 
						and what are the most important soft skills, of course this allows me to know what fields and areas I should be concentrating when it comes to my studies.</p>  
				
				
						<h3><a name="_Toc69739718"></a>Reane Nadina Sutoyo</h3>
						<img src="images/rea.jpeg" width="200">
						<p>Student Number:s3910959 Email address:

							<a href="mailto:s3910959@student.rmit.edu.au">s3910959@student.rmit.edu.au</a></p>
						<p>Personal website link: <a href="https://reanesutoyo.github.io/reanesutoyo">https://reanesutoyo.github.io/reanesutoyo</a></p>
						<p>Reane is a freelance graphic designer based in Sydney. She also working part time as Retail
							Assistant during the weekdays. She grew up in Indonesia and now residing in Sydney. She
							spent her free time going to gym and attend gym classes to keep herself active and healthy.
							Her hobbies are drawing, painting, designing, cooking and reading books.</p>
						<p>She also enjoys spending time outdoors, she likes to go to the beach, hiking and also being
							in nature.</p>
						<p>She has been interested to pursue career in IT field since there is more needs for designer
							to have technical skills to be able to make a fully working Website or Apps. She chose
							aRMIT University because studying online, it&rsquo;s more flexible with her working
							schedule. Shehas an experience to make a basic webpage using HTML5 and CSS.</p>
						<h6>ENFP-A</h6>
						<p>Reane has ENFP personality type with this type of personality are often described as enthusiastic, charismatic, and creative. People with this personality type are very charming, energetic, and independent.
							Reane are creative and help bring different solution for a problem in the team and also like to be involve and socialize with other team member.</p>
						
						<h3>GROUP PROCESS</h3>

						<p>I think working together as a team help us generating new ideas and be more creative on our approach of solving problem and issues towards getting our project done. 
						The different perspectives can help us to generate better ideas by combining ideas that we have together and sharing ideas also accelerates the creative process.
						It’s good that we are motivating each other to finish our group project and be more productive. </p>
						<p>I felt that everyone has strength and characteristics that can bring to team success. 
						Because I knew some of us already working in IT and already work as programmer, 
						and for me I can do the design part. It’s good that everyone is not afraid to voice their suggestions,
						and I think we are dividing the workload well and everyone working hard to accomplish great result.  
						Also, everyone is also very encouraging and although we only met like once a week for team meeting, 
						we make sure that our task is finished on time.</p>
				
						<h3>CAREER PLANS</h3>

						<p>My Career plan still the same from beginning, I want to become a Web and Application designer that not only know how to make a visually appealing design, 
						but I also know how to program the website and applications as well. 
						I think for me personally I know there is so many programming languages out there that I have to master in order to be really good full-stack web developer.</p>
				
						<p>I think my career plan is to start small like working as web designer first while studying online with RMIT University, 
						and I think Information Technology is always evolving, so I must keep my skills update with the current industry standard which why I really like this idea of long-life learning. Also, 
						beside that I have interest with UX and UI of website and application development as well because I know is one of design job that in demand as well. </p>
						<p>Since I am learning about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, 
						I have developed an interest to have more understanding about making Chat Bot for Business. 
						I think there is a lot of market for these services since Business like an idea of automating and costing cost. 
						Overall, I feel that there are many areas in Information Technology that I really like to explore, 
						although I would like to focus my effort to do more web development area first.</p>
				
						<h3><a name="_Toc69739719"></a>John Hurst</h3>
						<img src="images/john.jpeg" width="200">

						<p>Student Number:s3882857 Email address:

						<a href="s3882857@student.rmit.edu.au">s3882857@student.rmit.edu.au</a></p>
						<p>Personal website link : <a href="https://s3882857.github.io/">https://s3882857.github.io/</a></p>
						<p>John was born in Sandringham hospital in Victoria, and have spent the majority of his life living in Cheltenham, Victoria. As healthy individual whose main interests and hobbies have always been exercise, Science, Technology, weight-lifting, and is a great home-cook. The more knowledge acquired from exercise and working out, the more he realises how important life- style, health, and tasty foods keeps you on the move. Beyond that, science and technology have always been become John’s intellectual passions, this started during his adolescent years, when he became obsessed with arcade games. With the encouragement of his parents and his sister who was a computer programmer, John had experience with coding at a very young age. However, life is not always as planned, after a lack of lustre, or underachieving finish to his High School year, he found himself working in bank which was never his interest. </p>
						<p>But determined, john completed his first advanced diploma in IT in 1998. John began working as a programmer and is well experienced with older languages such as PIC and BBX,  with a level expertise in Java and JavaScript. As technology evolves as a rapid speed, it lead john to realise that he wanted to a university degree that would further progress his career and passion in IT.  .</p>
							<h6>INTJ-A</h6>
						<p>Like Marc from our group, John is also an “Architect” with an INTJ-A personality. John finds joy working alone, getting work done is a swift when he is working by himself. However, when working in a team, he keeps the group organised, scheduled, and future focused just like he is, adding a sense of self-awareness that allows everyone to get on the game. Like the passion with programming, when he has an target, it is long-lived, and he will stick with that target/purpose for a long time, any short lived plans for him is just a waste of time. Effectively fulfilling the ultimate goals of the team in a consistent manner. </p>
						<h3>GROUP PROCESS</h3> 

						<p>The group worked well together. The Assignment 2 was relatively easy to divide up into sections. 
						Each person was able to focus on their individual task. Little need to communicate in regular meetings. 
						This is an ambitious and proactive group. Little follow up was required of each member.</p>
				
						<p>I thought it would be a good idea to introduce a little more follow-up on work progress. I
						also suggested using the file system a little more to be able to review peoples progress, 
						but this did not occur. 
						We still reverted to using a single document to enter in all the report information.
						This is not really a very practical method as the document is quite long it becomes cumbersome 
						and slow to refresh and respond. Using shorter more precise documents is the best solution. 
						But alas this has fallen on deaf ears. The document should be broken up into separate files for each section so to enable faster more efficient updating of the content.</p>
						<p>Our meetings, when held, were relatively well run. 
						In general Alice acted as the primary host. However, it seems we had even less meetings than in Assignment 2.
						I don't think this has been a totally bad thing, but it has not helped. 
						It has been difficult to organize the meetings due to scheduling conflicts etc. Or possible due to a lack of interest, I am not sure.  

						Strong leadership is absent in this group. 
						There are no strong assertive people present. Which I think has served us well. My impression of each member, although they are ambitious diligent workers, seems to be more about standing back and letting it all happen.</p>
						<p>Most of us have been hesitant to take on a leadership role. Maybe in fear of too much responsibility, again not sure. However, 
						this lack of true or strong leadership has benefited this group. In that, within each member leadership skills are present.
						Which is why I think we benefited from not having a strong leader to contest with. At this point I would have to start questioning the value of strong leadership at all. It depends on who the team members are.</p>
				
						<p>Again, I would have to say our communication has been Okay. But it does need some work. At times we seemed to have lost our way a little. In the beginning, we lacked clear direction. However, each member has been able to understand, take on tasks, and investigate assigned tasks and issues relatively well.</p>
						<h3>CAREER PLANS</h3>

						<p>I am still focused on becoming a Developer of all sorts. A Scientific Programmer is still fine. Possibly a Computer Games Developer. 
						I have not changed or completely rediscovered my future. But it has changed in the types of technologies I would like to understand and pursue.</p>
						<p> Where I was once uninterested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning etc. I have now become fascinated and determined to learn everything I can about it. I can see this being integrated into my tooling requirements.
						AI will be a part of every form of Computer Systems Development well into the future. Whether as a part of Scientific Developer, Games Developer, or Full Stack Developer. This is a fascinating time to be in IT.</p>
